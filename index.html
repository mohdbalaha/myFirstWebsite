            Applying ROT13 to a piece of text merely requires examining its alphabetic characters and replacing each one by the letter
            13 places further along in the alphabet, wrapping back to the beginning if necessary. [3] A becomes N, B becomes
            O, and so on up to M, which becomes Z, then the sequence continues at the beginning of the alphabet: N becomes
            A, O becomes B, and so on to Z, which becomes M. Only those letters which occur in the English alphabet are affected;
            numbers, symbols, whitespace, and all other characters are left unchanged. Because there are 26 letters in the
            English alphabet and 26 = 2 Ã— 13, the ROT13 function is its own inverse.
